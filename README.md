# QuizAppProj2
Revature Project 2

Project Description

**Application Description**
This application allows users of the service to access a database of quiz
questions related to programming technologies. Its programmed in Swift
through the XCode IDE because the application is meant for iOS specific use.
For future updates, the application could use some updates on the UI and more
integration testing needs to be done. An example would be how the application
demos a user being able to claim rewards based on their technology ranking. Testing
would need to be done to demonstrate the proper functionality of how this works, or
to demonstrate what happens when a quiz reaches 0. Some tests were conducted, but more
would be requirde to catch as many bugs as possible.

**Installation**
To Install and run the project, running the application should be done in XCode and iPhones
11+ should be selected for best interfaces. All required packages and dependencies are included
so nothing needs to be downloaded.

**How to use**
To use the application:
1. Log in or sign up as a user or an admin.
